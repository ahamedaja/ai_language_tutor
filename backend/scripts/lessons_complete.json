      "notes": "English grammar forms the foundation of effective communication. Grammar is the system and structure of a language, consisting of the rules that govern how words combine to form sentences. The main components of grammar include:\n\n1. PARTS OF SPEECH: Every word in English belongs to one of nine main categories.\n\n2. SENTENCE STRUCTURE: Sentences are built from subjects (who or what), predicates (what they do), and objects (what receives the action).\n\n3. PUNCTUATION: Symbols that clarify meaning and structure.\n\n4. AGREEMENT: Words must match in number and person.\n\n5. WORD ORDER: English follows a specific Subject-Verb-Object pattern.\n\nWhy Grammar Matters:\n- Clarity: Grammar ensures your message is understood correctly\n- Professionalism: Proper grammar is expected in formal writing and speech\n- Credibility: Good grammar builds trust and authority\n- Consistency: Grammar rules create predictable patterns\n\nKey Principles:\n- Every sentence needs a subject and a verb\n- Words must agree in number and tense\n- Punctuation clarifies meaning\n- Word order affects meaning\n- Modifiers should be placed clearly",

      "description": "Master the nine parts of speech: nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, interjections, and articles. Understand how each part functions in sentences.",
      "notes": "The nine parts of speech are the building blocks of English sentences. Each word belongs to one category based on its function:\n\n1. NOUNS: Words that name people, places, things, or ideas (person, London, book, freedom). Types include proper nouns (capitalized specific names) and common nouns (general names).\n\n2. PRONOUNS: Words that replace nouns to avoid repetition (he, she, it, they, who, myself). Types include personal, possessive, reflexive, demonstrative, relative, and interrogative pronouns.\n\n3. VERBS: Action words that show what someone or something does or is (run, sit, be, create). They can be action verbs (physical or mental) or linking verbs (connect subject to description).\n\n4. ADJECTIVES: Words that describe or modify nouns or pronouns (beautiful, tall, red, interesting). They answer questions like: What kind? How many? Which one?\n\n5. ADVERBS: Words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs (quickly, very, yesterday, soon). They often end in -ly and answer questions like: How? When? Where? To what extent?\n\n6. PREPOSITIONS: Words that show relationships between nouns and other words (in, on, under, between, during, before). They typically show position, time, or relationship.\n\n7. CONJUNCTIONS: Words that connect words, phrases, or clauses (and, but, or, because, although). Coordinating conjunctions join equal elements; subordinating conjunctions join dependent clauses to independent clauses.\n\n8. INTERJECTIONS: Exclamations that express emotion (wow, oh, hey, great!). They often stand alone and are followed by exclamation marks.\n\n9. ARTICLES: Words that modify nouns (a, an, the). 'The' is definite (specific); 'a' and 'an' are indefinite (not specific).",

      "notes": "English uses tenses to show when an action happens. There are three main time periods (present, past, future) and four aspects (simple, continuous, perfect, perfect continuous), creating 12 tenses:\n\nPRESENT TENSES:\n1. Simple Present: Habits, facts, general truths (I eat, He eats)\n2. Present Continuous: Actions happening now (I am eating)\n3. Present Perfect: Actions from past with present relevance (I have eaten)\n4. Present Perfect Continuous: Actions ongoing from past to now (I have been eating)\n\nPAST TENSES:\n5. Simple Past: Completed actions in the past (I ate)\n6. Past Continuous: Actions happening at a specific past time (I was eating)\n7. Past Perfect: Actions completed before another past action (I had eaten)\n8. Past Perfect Continuous: Ongoing actions in past before another action (I had been eating)\n\nFUTURE TENSES:\n9. Simple Future: Actions that will happen (I will eat / I am going to eat)\n10. Future Continuous: Ongoing actions in the future (I will be eating)\n11. Future Perfect: Actions completed by a future time (I will have eaten)\n12. Future Perfect Continuous: Ongoing actions continuing into future (I will have been eating)\n\nCHOOSING THE RIGHT TENSE depends on:\n- When the action occurs (present, past, future)\n- The nature of the action (complete, ongoing, habitual)\n- Its relationship to other events\n- The speaker's perspective\n\nCOMMON TENSE MARKERS:\n- Present Simple: always, usually, often, sometimes, never\n- Present Continuous: now, right now, at this moment\n- Past Simple: yesterday, last week, ago, in 1995\n- Present Perfect: just, already, yet, recently, since, for\n- Future Simple: tomorrow, next week, in 2030, will\n- Future Continuous: at this time tomorrow, tonight at 8pm",

      "description": "Master the rules of subject-verb agreement to ensure grammatical correctness. Learn to identify singular and plural subjects and match them with appropriate verbs.",
      "notes": "Subject-verb agreement is a fundamental rule: the verb must match the subject in number (singular or plural) and person (first, second, or third).\n\nBASIC RULES:\n1. Singular subjects take singular verbs; plural subjects take plural verbs.\n   - The cat is sleeping. (Singular subject 'cat' + singular verb 'is')\n   - The cats are sleeping. (Plural subject 'cats' + plural verb 'are')\n\n2. Third person singular present tense verbs usually end in -s or -es.\n   - He walks to school. (Not 'he walk')\n   - She catches fish. (Not 'she catch')\n\n3. Plural verbs in present tense don't add -s or -es.\n   - They walk to school. (Not 'they walks')\n   - We catch fish. (Not 'we catches')\n\nTRICKY SITUATIONS:\n4. Compound subjects joined by 'and' usually take plural verbs.\n   - John and Mary are friends. (Both are friends)\n\n5. Compound subjects joined by 'or' or 'nor' take a verb matching the nearest subject.\n   - Neither the teacher nor the students were present.\n   - Either the cats or the dog is responsible.\n\n6. Collective nouns (group, team, family) can be singular or plural depending on context.\n   - The team is winning. (Treated as one unit)\n   - The team are preparing their equipment. (Members acting individually)\n\n7. Indefinite pronouns (everyone, somebody, nobody) are typically singular.\n   - Everyone has arrived. (Not 'have')\n\n8. Indefinite pronouns (both, few, many, several) are plural.\n   - Many have volunteered.\n\n9. Words between subject and verb don't affect agreement.\n   - The manager, along with the staff, is attending. (Subject is 'manager')\n   - The students in the class are learning. (Subject is 'students')\n\n10. Quantifiers like 'half of', 'most of', 'none of' depend on the noun that follows.\n    - Half of the pie is gone. (Pie is singular)\n    - Half of the apples are gone. (Apples are plural)",

      "notes": "Voice indicates whether the subject performs the action (active) or receives the action (passive).\n\nACTIVE VOICE:\nStructure: Subject + Verb + Object\nThe subject performs the action.\nExample: The chef prepared the meal.\n- Who does the action? The chef (subject)\n- What action? Prepared\n- To what/whom? The meal (object)\n\nCharacteristics of Active Voice:\n- More direct and forceful\n- Clearer who is responsible\n- More concise\n- Preferred in most writing\n- Subject is emphasized\n\nPASSIVE VOICE:\nStructure: Subject + Auxiliary verb (be) + Past participle + (by + agent)\nThe subject receives the action.\nExample: The meal was prepared by the chef.\n- Who receives the action? The meal (subject)\n- What happened? Was prepared\n- By whom? By the chef (agent)\n\nCharacteristics of Passive Voice:\n- More formal tone\n- Emphasizes the action or object\n- Agent (who did the action) can be omitted\n- Longer and wordier\n- Useful when agent is unknown or irrelevant\n- Common in scientific and academic writing",

          "answer": "Active with unknown agent changed to Passive without agent | 'My bicycle' becomes subject | 'was stolen' is the passive form",

By the end of the day, I had made three new friends and discovered the library. When I returned home, I felt excited about going back the next day.'",
