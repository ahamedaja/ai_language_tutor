# ✅ Frontend Data Display - FIXED

## Problem Identified and Resolved

### The Issue
The frontend was not showing:
- ❌ Practical Examples (showing empty)
- ❌ Quiz Questions (showing 0 questions instead of 50)

### Root Cause
**Database Mismatch**: The backend was configured to use `tutor_db` but the data was seeded into `english_tutor`.

```
Backend using:    tutor_db (had old sample data with 5 examples, 0 quizzes)
Seeded data in:   english_tutor (had new data: 3 examples, 50 quizzes)
```

### Solution Applied

**File Modified:** `backend/app/db.py`

Changed default database from:
```python
DB_NAME = os.getenv("MONGO_DB", "tutor_db")  # ❌ OLD
```

To:
```python
DB_NAME = os.getenv("MONGO_DB", "english_tutor")  # ✅ NEW
```

### Verification

**Before Fix:**
```
GET /api/lessons/basics-of-english-grammar
  - title: "Past Simple Tense"
  - examples: 5 (old sample data)
  - quiz questions: 0
```

**After Fix:**
```
GET /api/lessons/basics-of-english-grammar
  - title: "Basics of English Grammar"
  - examples: 3 ✅
  - quiz questions: 50 ✅

Quiz Breakdown:
  ✅ Multiple Choice: 10 questions
  ✅ True/False: 10 questions
  ✅ Fill in the Blanks: 10 questions
  ✅ Sentence Correction: 10 questions
  ✅ Short Answer: 10 questions
  Total: 50 questions per lesson
```
