      "notes": "English grammar forms the foundation of effective communication. Grammar is the system and structure of a language, consisting of the rules that govern how words combine to form sentences. The main components of grammar include:\n\n1. PARTS OF SPEECH: Every word in English belongs to one of nine main categories.\n\n2. SENTENCE STRUCTURE: Sentences are built from subjects (who or what), predicates (what they do), and objects (what receives the action).\n\n3. PUNCTUATION: Symbols that clarify meaning and structure.\n\n4. AGREEMENT: Words must match in number and person.\n\n5. WORD ORDER: English follows a specific Subject-Verb-Object pattern.\n\nWhy Grammar Matters:\n- Clarity: Grammar ensures your message is understood correctly\n- Professionalism: Proper grammar is expected in formal writing and speech\n- Credibility: Good grammar builds trust and authority\n- Consistency: Grammar rules create predictable patterns\n\nKey Principles:\n- Every sentence needs a subject and a verb\n- Words must agree in number and tense\n- Punctuation clarifies meaning\n- Word order affects meaning\n- Modifiers should be placed clearly",

      "estimated_time": "50 minutes",
      "description": "Master the nine parts of speech: nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, interjections, and articles. Understand how each part functions in sentences.",
      "notes": "The nine parts of speech are the building blocks of English sentences. Each word belongs to one category based on its function:\n\n1. NOUNS: Words that name people, places, things, or ideas (person, London, book, freedom). Types include proper nouns (capitalized specific names) and common nouns (general names).\n\n2. PRONOUNS: Words that replace nouns to avoid repetition (he, she, it, they, who, myself). Types include personal, possessive, reflexive, demonstrative, relative, and interrogative pronouns.\n\n3. VERBS: Action words that show what someone or something does or is (run, sit, be, create). They can be action verbs (physical or mental) or linking verbs (connect subject to description).\n\n4. ADJECTIVES: Words that describe or modify nouns or pronouns (beautiful, tall, red, interesting). They answer questions like: What kind? How many? Which one?\n\n5. ADVERBS: Words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs (quickly, very, yesterday, soon). They often end in -ly and answer questions like: How? When? Where? To what extent?\n\n6. PREPOSITIONS: Words that show relationships between nouns and other words (in, on, under, between, during, before). They typically show position, time, or relationship.\n\n7. CONJUNCTIONS: Words that connect words, phrases, or clauses (and, but, or, because, although). Coordinating conjunctions join equal elements; subordinating conjunctions join dependent clauses to independent clauses.\n\n8. INTERJECTIONS: Exclamations that express emotion (wow, oh, hey, great!). They often stand alone and are followed by exclamation marks.\n\n9. ARTICLES: Words that modify nouns (a, an, the). 'The' is definite (specific); 'a' and 'an' are indefinite (not specific).",

      "notes": "English uses tenses to show when an action happens. There are three main time periods (present, past, future) and four aspects (simple, continuous, perfect, perfect continuous), creating 12 tenses:\n\nPRESENT TENSES:\n1. Simple Present: Habits, facts, general truths (I eat, He eats)\n2. Present Continuous: Actions happening now (I am eating)\n3. Present Perfect: Actions from past with present relevance (I have eaten)\n4. Present Perfect Continuous: Actions ongoing from past to now (I have been eating)\n\nPAST TENSES:\n5. Simple Past: Completed actions in the past (I ate)\n6. Past Continuous: Actions happening at a specific past time (I was eating)\n7. Past Perfect: Actions completed before another past action (I had eaten)\n8. Past Perfect Continuous: Ongoing actions in past before another action (I had been eating)\n\nFUTURE TENSES:\n9. Simple Future: Actions that will happen (I will eat / I am going to eat)\n10. Future Continuous: Ongoing actions in the future (I will be eating)\n11. Future Perfect: Actions completed by a future time (I will have eaten)\n12. Future Perfect Continuous: Ongoing actions continuing into future (I will have been eating)\n\nCHOOSING THE RIGHT TENSE depends on:\n- When the action occurs (present, past, future)\n- The nature of the action (complete, ongoing, habitual)\n- Its relationship to other events\n- The speaker's perspective\n\nCOMMON TENSE MARKERS:\n- Present Simple: always, usually, often, sometimes, never\n- Present Continuous: now, right now, at this moment\n- Past Simple: yesterday, last week, ago, in 1995\n- Present Perfect: just, already, yet, recently, since, for\n- Future Simple: tomorrow, next week, in 2030, will\n- Future Continuous: at this time tomorrow, tonight at 8pm",

      "description": "Master the rules of subject-verb agreement to ensure grammatical correctness. Learn to identify singular and plural subjects and match them with appropriate verbs.",
      "notes": "Subject-verb agreement is a fundamental rule: the verb must match the subject in number (singular or plural) and person (first, second, or third).\n\nBASIC RULES:\n1. Singular subjects take singular verbs; plural subjects take plural verbs.\n   - The cat is sleeping. (Singular subject 'cat' + singular verb 'is')\n   - The cats are sleeping. (Plural subject 'cats' + plural verb 'are')\n\n2. Third person singular present tense verbs usually end in -s or -es.\n   - He walks to school. (Not 'he walk')\n   - She catches fish. (Not 'she catch')\n\n3. Plural verbs in present tense don't add -s or -es.\n   - They walk to school. (Not 'they walks')\n   - We catch fish. (Not 'we catches')\n\nTRICKY SITUATIONS:\n4. Compound subjects joined by 'and' usually take plural verbs.\n   - John and Mary are friends. (Both are friends)\n\n5. Compound subjects joined by 'or' or 'nor' take a verb matching the nearest subject.\n   - Neither the teacher nor the students were present.\n   - Either the cats or the dog is responsible.\n\n6. Collective nouns (group, team, family) can be singular or plural depending on context.\n   - The team is winning. (Treated as one unit)\n   - The team are preparing their equipment. (Members acting individually)\n\n7. Indefinite pronouns (everyone, somebody, nobody) are typically singular.\n   - Everyone has arrived. (Not 'have')\n\n8. Indefinite pronouns (both, few, many, several) are plural.\n   - Many have volunteered.\n\n9. Words between subject and verb don't affect agreement.\n   - The manager, along with the staff, is attending. (Subject is 'manager')\n   - The students in the class are learning. (Subject is 'students')\n\n10. Quantifiers like 'half of', 'most of', 'none of' depend on the noun that follows.\n    - Half of the pie is gone. (Pie is singular)\n    - Half of the apples are gone. (Apples are plural)",

      "notes": "Voice indicates whether the subject performs the action (active) or receives the action (passive).\n\nACTIVE VOICE:\nStructure: Subject + Verb + Object\nThe subject performs the action.\nExample: The chef prepared the meal.\n- Who does the action? The chef (subject)\n- What action? Prepared\n- To what/whom? The meal (object)\n\nCharacteristics of Active Voice:\n- More direct and forceful\n- Clearer who is responsible\n- More concise\n- Preferred in most writing\n- Subject is emphasized\n\nPASSIVE VOICE:\nStructure: Subject + Auxiliary verb (be) + Past participle + (by + agent)\nThe subject receives the action.\nExample: The meal was prepared by the chef.\n- Who receives the action? The meal (subject)\n- What happened? Was prepared\n- By whom? By the chef (agent)\n\nCharacteristics of Passive Voice:\n- More formal tone\n- Emphasizes the action or object\n- Agent (who did the action) can be omitted\n- Longer and wordier\n- Useful when agent is unknown or irrelevant\n- Common in scientific and academic writing\n\nCONVERTING ACTIVE TO PASSIVE:\n1. Identify the object of the active sentence (becomes subject)\n2. Use appropriate form of 'be' + past participle\n3. If needed, add the agent after 'by'\n\nExample: The company hired fifty employees.\n→ Fifty employees were hired by the company.\n\nUSES OF PASSIVE VOICE:\n- Scientific writing: 'The samples were analyzed.'\n- When agent is unknown: 'My wallet was stolen.'\n- When agent is unimportant: 'The game was cancelled.'\n- To emphasize the action or receiver: 'The president was elected by the people.'\n- Legal/formal writing: 'The contract was signed.'\n\nWHEN TO AVOID PASSIVE VOICE:\n- In narrative writing (use active for clarity)\n- In instructions (use active for directness)\n- When agent is important and relevant\n- In persuasive writing (active is more compelling)",

Cannot stand alone; must be attached to an independent clause.\n- Example: \"Although it is cold outside...\" (leaves you wondering what happens)\n- Types: Adverbial (tell when, where, why, how), Adjective (describe nouns), Noun (act as nouns)\n\nFOUR TYPES OF SENTENCES:\n\n1. SIMPLE SENTENCE\nOne independent clause, one subject and one verb\nStructure: Subject + Verb + Object\nExamples:\n- \"The cat sleeps.\" (one subject, one verb)\n- \"The cat and dog play together.\" (compound subject, one verb)\n- \"She writes and illustrates children's books.\" (one subject, compound verb)\nUse: Brief statements, clear ideas\n\n2. COMPOUND SENTENCE\nTwo or more independent clauses joined by coordinators (and, but, or, so, yet, nor, for)\nStructure: Independent Clause + Coordinator + Independent Clause\nExamples:\n- \"The sun was shining, and the birds were singing.\" (and)\n- \"I wanted to go out, but it was raining.\" (but)\n- \"You can take the bus, or you can walk.\" (or)\nPunctuation Rule: Use comma + coordinator OR semicolon (;) without coordinator\n- \"The sun was shining; the birds were singing.\" (semicolon alone)\nUse: Equal importance, related ideas\n\n3. COMPLEX SENTENCE\nOne independent clause + one or more dependent clauses\nStructure: Dependent Clause + Independent Clause (or vice versa)\nExamples:\n- \"After we finished our homework, we watched a movie.\" (dependent + independent)\n- \"We watched a movie after we finished our homework.\" (independent + dependent)\n- \"When you arrive, if the door is locked, call me.\" (two dependent + independent)\nPunctuation Rule: Use comma after dependent clause if it comes first. No comma if dependent clause comes last (usually).\nSubordinators: because, although, while, when, since, unless, before, after, if, etc.\nUse: Varying ideas, showing relationships between ideas\n\n4. COMPOUND-COMPLEX SENTENCE\nTwo or more independent clauses + one or more dependent clauses\nStructure: (Independent + Dependent) + Coordinator + Independent\nExamples:\n- \"After we ate dinner, we went to a movie, and then we came home.\" (dependent + independent + coordinator + independent)\n- \"Although she was tired, she kept working, and her boss appreciated her effort.\" (dependent + independent + coordinator + independent)\nUse: Multiple ideas with varying relationships\n\nSENTENCE FRAGMENTS (Errors to Avoid):\nIncomplete sentences that lack subject, verb, or complete thought\n- Fragment: \"Because it was raining.\" (incomplete dependent clause)\n- Correct: \"Because it was raining, we stayed inside.\"\n\nRUN-ON SENTENCES (Errors to Avoid):\nTwo independent clauses joined incorrectly\n- Run-on: \"I love coffee I drink it every morning.\" (missing comma + coordinator or semicolon)\n- Correct: \"I love coffee, and I drink it every morning.\" or \"I love coffee; I drink it every morning.\"",

      "notes": "A paragraph is a group of related sentences that develop one main idea. Strong paragraphs are the building blocks of effective writing.\n\nPARAGRAPH STRUCTURE:\n\n1. TOPIC SENTENCE\nThe main idea of the paragraph, usually placed first\nCharacteristics:\n- States the subject and main point\n- Gives direction to the paragraph\n- Is broad enough to be developed but specific enough to be clear\n- Often contains a controlling idea that limits the scope\nExample: \"Social media has both positive and negative effects on teenage mental health.\"\n\n2. SUPPORTING SENTENCES (BODY)\nDevelop and support the topic sentence with details, examples, evidence\nTypes of support:\n- Examples: Specific instances that illustrate the point\n- Facts: Verifiable information\n- Statistics: Numerical data\n- Quotes: Direct evidence from sources\n- Explanations: Clarification of complex ideas\n- Comparisons: Similarities and differences\nTechniques:\n- Coherence: Information flows logically\n- Unity: All sentences relate to the topic\n- Transitions: Words/phrases connecting ideas (however, therefore, furthermore, as a result)\n\n3. CONCLUDING SENTENCE\nSummarizes the main point or provides final thoughts\nCharacteristics:\n- Restates or reinforces the topic sentence (not word-for-word)\n- May provide broader implications\n- Connects back to the main idea\n- Signals end of the paragraph\nExample: \"Understanding both advantages and disadvantages of social media helps teenagers make informed decisions.\"\n\nPARAGRAPH TYPES BY PURPOSE:\n\nNARRATIVE PARAGRAPH:\nTells a story or describes events in chronological order\nStructure: Introduction → Events (in order) → Conclusion\nTransitions: First, then, next, after, finally, meanwhile\n\nDESCRIPTIVE PARAGRAPH:\nPaints a picture using sensory details\nStructure: Topic (what) → Sensory details (how it looks, sounds, feels, etc.) → Conclusion\nUses: Adjectives, active verbs, metaphors\n\nEXPOSITORY PARAGRAPH:\nExplains or informs about a topic\nStructure: Topic → Explanation/Definition → Examples → Conclusion\nCommon in textbooks and informative writing\n\nPERSUASIVE PARAGRAPH:\nAttempts to convince the reader of a position\nStructure: Topic (opinion) → Reasons → Evidence → Conclusion\nUses: Strong reasoning, credible evidence, persuasive language\n\nPARAGRAPH COHERENCE TECHNIQUES:\n\n1. REPEATED KEY WORDS\nRepeat important words to maintain focus\nExample: \"The book explores themes of identity. These themes appear throughout the narrative.\"\n\n2. PRONOUNS\nUse pronouns (it, they, this) to refer back to previous ideas\nExample: \"The new policy has been controversial. However, critics believe it will improve efficiency.\"\n\n3. TRANSITIONS\nConnect ideas smoothly:\n- Adding: furthermore, additionally, moreover, also\n- Contrasting: however, on the other hand, yet, but\n- Cause/Effect: therefore, as a result, because, so\n- Time: meanwhile, later, subsequently, finally\n- Example: for example, such as, specifically\n\n4. PARALLEL STRUCTURE\nUse similar grammatical structures for related ideas\nExample: \"The campaign focused on increasing awareness, reducing costs, and improving quality.\" (All use gerunds)\n\nPARAGRAPH LENGTH:\nUsually 3-8 sentences (100-300 words)\nLength depends on purpose and complexity\nKeep paragraphs unified around one central idea\n\nCOMMON PARAGRAPH PROBLEMS:\n\nTOPIC DRIFT: Paragraph loses focus\nFix: Ensure all sentences relate to the topic sentence\n\nLACK OF DEVELOPMENT: Topic not sufficiently explored\nFix: Add specific examples, details, or evidence\n\nPOOR ORGANIZATION: Ideas don't flow logically\nFix: Rearrange sentences or add transitions\n\nWEAK TOPIC SENTENCE: Main idea unclear\nFix: Make topic sentence clear and specific\n\nUNRELATED INFORMATION: Off-topic sentences included\nFix: Remove or move sentences that don't support main idea",
